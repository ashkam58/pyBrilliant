# Big-O Coding Playground

Welcome to the coding-focused Big-O playground! Here, you'll see how different algorithms scale as you change input size, and visualize their growth with interactive charts.

---

## 1. Linear Search (O(n))

Try searching for a value in a list. The number of steps grows with the list size.

## 2. Binary Search (O(log n))

Binary search splits the list in half each time. See how much faster it is for large lists!

## 3. Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is a classic way to compare Big-O. See how bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort scale.

## 4. Custom Growth Playground

Use the sliders and checkboxes below to compare constant, logarithmic, linear, and quadratic growth. Try changing n and see which explodes fastest!

## Challenge: Guess the Complexity!

<QuizMCQ
question="Which algorithm has O(log n) complexity?"
choices={["Linear search", "Binary search", "Bubble sort", "Selection sort"]}
answer="Binary search"
explanation="Binary search splits the list in half each time, making it O(log n)."
/>

<QuizMCQ
question="If you double the input size for a quadratic algorithm, how does the work change?"
choices={["Doubles", "Quadruples", "Stays the same", "Halves"]}
answer="Quadruples"
explanation="Quadratic growth means work scales with n², so doubling n makes work 4x."
/>

## Custom Algorithm Challenge

Try writing your own algorithm below and estimate its Big-O class. Discuss with your classmates or teacher!

```python
# Example: Count pairs in a list
def count_pairs(lst):
	count = 0
	for i in range(len(lst)):
		for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):
			count += 1
	return count
# What is the Big-O complexity?
# (Answer: O(n^2))
```

## Key Takeaways

- **O(1)**: Constant time — doesn't grow with input size.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic — grows slowly, even for big inputs.
- **O(n)**: Linear — grows directly with input size.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic — explodes as input grows!

Use the playground above to experiment and see these patterns in action.
