# Python 101 — A Playful Intro 🐍✨


## What you’ll learn (TL;DR)
- Run Python from terminal like a boss.
- Variables, data types, and printing (aka “talking to the console”).
- Branching with `if` and looping with `for` / `while`.
- Lists & dictionaries (and a peek at *references* a.k.a. “pointers”).
- A tiny project: **Guess‑the‑Number**.
- 5 rapid‑fire drills to make it stick.

---

<VariableGuess />

> 💡 **Phrase drop — “rule of thumb”**: a practical general guideline (not exact law). You’ll see these sprinkled in.

---

## Setup (2 mins)
- Check Python: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- Open VS Code (or your fave editor). Create a folder like `python‑kids/`.
- Make a file `hello.py` inside it.

```python
print("Hello, Python world! ✨")
```

Run it:
- Windows: `py hello.py` (or `python hello.py`)
- macOS/Linux: `python3 hello.py`

> 💡 **“Where the rubber meets the road”** = where theory becomes action. That moment is now.

---

## 0. Python is a conversation
Python reads top‑to‑bottom. You write instructions; Python obeys (politely). Whitespace matters, punctuation matters, and your curiosity matters the most.

---

## 1. Variables & Types
Variables are **labels** pointing to **values**.

```python
name = "Aarav"        # str (string)
age = 12              # int (integer)
height = 1.49         # float
is_coder = True       # bool

print(name, age, height, is_coder)
```

> 📝 **Word** — **“concise”**: brief but complete. Your code should be concise.

**Mini‑drill**: Change `age` and `height`, print a sentence: `Aarav is 13 and 1.51m tall.`

---

## 2. Input + Output

```python
name = input("Your name? ")
print("Welcome,", name)
```

> ⚠️ `input()` always returns a **string**. Convert when needed:

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(num * 10)
```

---

## 3. If / Elif / Else

```python
score = int(input("Score (0–100): "))
if score >= 90:
    print("A — Ace!")
elif score >= 75:
    print("B — Breezy.")
else:
    print("Keep grinding ✊")
```

> 💬 **Phrase** — **“edge case”**: a weird corner scenario your code must still handle (like score = 101 😅).

---

## 4. Loops (For & While)

```python
# For: known counts
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Beat", i)

# While: repeat until a condition changes
countdown = 5
while countdown > 0:
    print(countdown)
    countdown -= 1
print("Lift‑off 🚀")
```

---

## 5. Functions (Your Reusable Spells)

```python
def area_rect(w, h):
    return w * h

print(area_rect(5, 3))
```

> 💡 **“By and large”** = generally speaking. By and large, functions keep code clean.

---

## 6. Collections — Lists & Dicts

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30]
nums.append(40)
print(nums)  # [10, 20, 30, 40]

student = {"name": "Aarushi", "grade": 4}
student["likes"] = ["math", "drawing"]
print(student)
```

**List iteration**
```python
for x in nums:
    print(x)
```

**Dictionary iteration**
```python
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, "→", value)
```

---

## 7. References (Pointers) — Quick Peek
In Python, variables hold **references** to objects. Two names can point to the **same list**.

```python
a = [1, 2]
b = a         # b references the same list as a
b.append(3)
print(a)  # [1, 2, 3]
print(b)  # [1, 2, 3]

b = [9]       # now b points to a NEW list
print(a)  # [1, 2, 3]
print(b)  # [9]
```

> 🧠 **Rule of thumb**: mutating a shared object (like a list) changes it for **all** references.

Make a **copy** if you want independence:

```python
original = [1, 2, 3]
clone = original[:]      # or list(original) or original.copy()
clone.append(999)
print(original)  # [1, 2, 3]
print(clone)     # [1, 2, 3, 999]
```

## 8. Five Rapid Drills (2–3 mins)
1) **Sum 1..N**: read `n` and print sum `1+2+...+n`.
2) **FizzBuzz lite**: for 1..20 print `Fizz` if multiple of 3, `Buzz` if 5, `FizzBuzz` if 15, else the number.
3) **Max of three**: read 3 ints, print the largest (no `max()`—use `if`).
4) **Count vowels**: read a word, count `aeiou`.
5) **List squares**: given `n`, build a list `[1,4,9,...,n^2]`.

<details>
<summary>💡 Hints</summary>

- Use `range(1, n+1)` for inclusive counting.
- For vowels: `if ch.lower() in "aeiou": ...`
- Build lists with `.append()`.

</details>

---

## 9. Pattern Printing (taste test)

```python
# right triangle
rows = int(input("Rows: "))
for r in range(1, rows+1):
    print("*" * r)
```

Try: centered pyramid, inverted pyramid, and a hollow square.

<details>
<summary>✨ Thinking pattern</summary>
Break the shape into **rows** and **columns**. For each row, decide:
- How many spaces?
- How many symbols?
- Border vs inside?
</details>

---

## 10. Mini‑Project — Guess the Number 🎯

```python
import random

secret = random.randint(1, 50)
tries = 0

print("I picked a number from 1..50. Can you guess it?")

while True:
    g = int(input("Your guess: "))
    tries += 1

    if g < secret:
        print("Too low 🥶")
    elif g > secret:
        print("Too high 🔥")
    else:
        print(f"Bang on! You did it in {tries} tries.")
        break
```

**Upgrades**: Add a max tries limit, difficulty levels, or hints like “within 5”.

---

## 11. Debug Habits (chef’s kiss)
- Read the error **from the bottom up**.
- `print()` values to see what’s happening.
- Shrink the problem: comment things out, isolate a tiny failing piece.
- Name things clearly: `total_sum` > `ts`.

> ✨ **Phrase** — **“TL;DR”**: *Too long; didn’t read*. Put a short summary at the top of big files.

---

## 12. Exit Ticket (quick check)
- I can run a `.py` file ✅
- I know `if/elif/else` ✅
- I can loop with `for` and `while` ✅
- I can explain why `a=b` (lists) shares the same object ✅

<details>
<summary>🧩 Quiz (3 Qs)</summary>

**1)** What type does `input()` return?
- A) `str`  
- B) `int`  
- C) `bool`

**2)** Fill the blank to copy a list: `copy = items[___]`

**3)** What prints?  
```python
a = [1,2]
b = a
b += [3]
print(a)
```

**Answers:** 1‑A, 2‑`[:]`, 3‑`[1,2,3]`

## 13. English Box — Level Up Your Teacher Voice
- **“Rule of thumb”** — practical guideline.  
- **“Edge case”** — unusual scenario you still must handle.  
- **“Where the rubber meets the road”** — where theory becomes action.  
- **“By and large”** — generally speaking.  
- **“Concise”** — brief yet complete.

Use these in class; kids catch phrases like Pokémon.

---

## What’s next?
- Build a **Pattern Playground** page.
- Add lessons: Strings, Slicing, `for ... else`, List Comprehensions, Errors & Exceptions.
- Save today’s code in Git with meaningful commit messages ("feat: add guess game").

> 🍀 **Final nudge**: Code a little **every day**. Momentum beats motivation.
