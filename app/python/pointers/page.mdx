## Understanding Pointers


Pointers are a fundamental concept in programming that help us understand how variables reference memory locations. Let's explore how pointers behave with different data types.


### Immutable Data Types: Integers


```python
num1 = 11
num2 = num1


# Both variables point to the same integer object
print(id(num1), id(num2))


num2 = 22
# num2 now points to a new integer object
print(id(num1), id(num2))
```


Integers are **immutable**, meaning their value cannot be changed once created. Assigning a new value creates a new object in memory.


<PointerPlayground 
  labels={{ num1: "Number 1", num2: "Number 2" }} 
  env={{ num1: 1, num2: 2 }} 
  heap={[
    { id: 1, kind: "int", value: 11, refs: [] },
    { id: 2, kind: "int", value: 22, refs: [] }
  ]}
/>


### Mutable Data Types: Dictionaries


```python
d1 = {"key": 11}
d2 = d1


# Both variables point to the same dictionary object
d2["key"] = 22
print(d1, d2)
```


Dictionaries are **mutable**, meaning their contents can be changed. Both variables continue to reference the same object in memory.


<PointerPlayground 
  labels={{ d1: "Dictionary 1", d2: "Dictionary 2" }} 
  env={{ d1: 1, d2: 1 }} 
  heap={[
    { id: 1, kind: "dict", value: { key: 22 }, refs: [] }
  ]}
/>


### Garbage Collection


When no variables reference an object, Python automatically removes it from memory through a process called **garbage collection**.


```python
d1 = {"key": 11}
d2 = d1
d2 = {"key": 22}
# The original dictionary is now eligible for garbage collection
```


> Python cleans up objects that are no longer referenced, freeing up memory.

question="After num1=11; num2=num1; num2=22; what is num1?"
choices={["11", "22", "Error", "Undefined"]}
answer="11"
explanation="num1 remains unchanged; num2 now points to a new integer object."

<QuizMCQ
question="After d1={key:11}; d2=d1; d2['key']=22; what is d1['key']?"
choices={["11", "22", "Error", "Undefined"]}
answer="22"
explanation="Both variables still point to the same dictionary, which was edited in place."

<QuizMCQ
question="What happens to an object when no variables reference it?"
choices={["It remains in memory", "It is garbage collected", "It causes an error", "It becomes undefined"]}
answer="It is garbage collected"
explanation="Python automatically removes unreferenced objects to free memory."
