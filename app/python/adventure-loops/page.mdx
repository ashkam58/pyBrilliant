## 🪄 Spell #1: The "For Loop" Incantation

### 📚 The Legend
Long ago, the ancient Python wizards discovered that some tasks needed to be repeated a specific number of times. They created the mystical `for` loop spell!

<DragonCave />

<CodeRunner starter={`# 🐉 Dragon Cave Challenge!
# Help our hero collect 5 magical gems from the dragon's cave

print("🏰 Entering the Dragon's Cave...")
print("🗡️  Hero draws sword and steps forward...")
print()

gems_collected = 0

for step in range(5):
    print(f"Step {step + 1}: 👀 Looking around...")
    print("✨ Found a magical gem!")
    gems_collected += 1
    print(f"💎 Gems collected: {gems_collected}")
    print("🚶 Moving deeper into the cave...")
    print()

print("🎉 Quest Complete! All gems collected!")
print(f"🏆 Final treasure: {gems_collected} magical gems!")
print("🐉 The dragon bows in respect and lets you pass!")`} />

## 🌟 Spell #2: The "While Loop" Enchantment

### 📚 The Prophecy
The while loop spell continues casting magic as long as a condition remains true. Perfect for unknown challenges ahead!

<TrollBridge />

<CodeRunner starter={`# 🌉 The Troll Bridge Challenge!
# Answer the troll's riddles until you get one right!

print("🌉 Approaching the ancient troll bridge...")
print("🧌 TROLL: 'HALT! Answer my riddles or face my wrath!'")
print()

riddles_attempted = 0
correct_answer = False

while not correct_answer:
    riddles_attempted += 1
    print(f"🤔 Riddle attempt #{riddles_attempted}")
    
    if riddles_attempted == 1:
        print("🧌 TROLL: 'What has 4 legs in morning, 2 at noon, 4 at night?'")
        print("🤷 HERO: 'A table?' (Wrong!)")
    elif riddles_attempted == 2:
        print("🧌 TROLL: 'What grows when shared?'")
        print("🤷 HERO: 'Pizza?' (Wrong again!)")
    elif riddles_attempted == 3:
        print("🧌 TROLL: 'What language do wizards code in?'")
        print("🧠 HERO: 'Python!' (Correct!)")
        correct_answer = True
    
    if not correct_answer:
        print("❌ Wrong! The troll laughs menacingly...")
        print("🔄 But heroes never give up!")
    print()

print("🎉 Correct! The troll steps aside with respect!")
print("🌉 Bridge unlocked! Path to the tower is clear!")
print(f"📊 Total attempts: {riddles_attempted}")`} />

## ⚡ Spell #3: The "Break & Continue" Magic

### 📚 The Ancient Art
Sometimes heroes need to skip obstacles or escape dangerous situations. Master these advanced techniques!

<TowerClimb />

<CodeRunner starter={`# 🏰 Climbing the Tower of Repetition!
# Some floors are safe, others are traps!

print("🏰 Starting the treacherous tower climb...")
print("🔮 Using magical detection to navigate safely...")
print()

floors_climbed = 0
safe_floors = 0

for floor in range(1, 21):  # 20 floors to climb
    print(f"🚶 Approaching floor {floor}...")
    
    # Skip cursed floors (multiples of 3)
    if floor % 3 == 0:
        print("💀 DANGER! Cursed floor detected!")
        print("🏃 Using CONTINUE spell to skip safely!")
        print("✨ *whoosh* - teleported past the trap!")
        print()
        continue
    
    # Check for the secret treasure room
    if floor == 15:
        print("🎉 SECRET TREASURE ROOM DISCOVERED!")
        print("💰 Found magical potion and golden key!")
        print("🔑 This key will unlock the princess's cell!")
        safe_floors += 1
        print()
        break  # Found what we need, no need to climb further!
    
    # Regular safe floor
    print(f"✅ Floor {floor} is safe!")
    print("🕯️  Lighting a torch and resting...")
    safe_floors += 1
    floors_climbed = floor
    print()

print("🏆 QUEST ACCOMPLISHED!")
print(f"🎯 Floors safely navigated: {safe_floors}")
print(f"🗝️  Secret treasure found on floor {floors_climbed}!")
print("👸 Princess Pythonia is FREE!")
print("🌟 You are now a Loop Master! 🌟")`} />
