# Control Flow Magic 🎯

<Callout type="tip">
**🎪 Welcome to the Control Flow Circus!** Get ready to make your programs think, decide, and choose their path like a smart robot! 🤖✨
</Callout>

## What you'll learn (TL;DR) 📋

• **Decision Making** with `if`, `elif`, and `else` - Teaching your code to think! 🧠  
• **Pattern Matching** with `match` - The cool new way to handle multiple choices! 🎯  
• **Break & Continue** - Control your loops like a pro! 🛑▶️  
• **Pass Statement** - The polite way to say "do nothing for now" 😴

## 🎭 Making Decisions with if Statements

Just like you decide what to wear based on the weather, Python can make decisions using **if statements**!

<CodeRunner starter={`# Let's help a robot decide what to do!
weather = "sunny"

if weather == "sunny":
    print("🌞 Let's go to the park!")
elif weather == "rainy":
    print("☔ Time for indoor games!")
elif weather == "snowy":
    print("⛄ Perfect for a snowman!")
else:
    print("🤔 Hmm, not sure about this weather...")

# Try changing 'weather' to "rainy" or "snowy"!`} />

<Callout type="note">
**🔍 Code Detective:** Notice how Python checks each condition **one by one**. Once it finds a match, it skips the rest! It's like choosing the first door that opens. 🚪

### 🎮 Interactive Challenge: Age Classifier

Let's build a fun age classifier that gives different messages based on age!

<CodeRunner starter={`# Age Classifier Challenge 🎂
age = 15

if age < 3:
    print("👶 Baby steps!")
    category = "Baby"
elif age < 13:
    print("🧒 Kid power!")
    category = "Kid"
elif age < 20:
    print("🌟 Teen energy!")
    category = "Teen"
elif age < 65:
    print("💪 Adult mode!")
    category = "Adult"
else:
    print("🌸 Wisdom mode!")
    category = "Senior"

print(f"Category: {category}")

# Try different ages: 2, 8, 16, 30, 70`} />

## 🎯 Pattern Matching with match Statements

Python 3.10 introduced **match statements** - think of it as a super-powered `if-elif` that can do pattern matching magic! ✨

<CodeRunner starter={`# HTTP Status Code Helper 🌐
def explain_status(status):
    match status:
        case 200:
            return "✅ Success! Everything is awesome!"
        case 404:
            return "🔍 Not Found - Page is playing hide and seek!"
        case 418:
            return "🫖 I'm a teapot - Yes, this is real!"
        case 500:
            return "💥 Server Error - Something went boom!"
        case status if status >= 400:
            return f"❌ Client/Server Error ({status})"
        case _:
            return f"📡 Status {status} - Unknown territory!"

# Test different status codes
for code in [200, 404, 418, 500, 403, 999]:
    print(f"{code}: {explain_status(code)}")
`} />

### 🎪 Advanced Pattern Matching: Point Classifier

<MatchPatternDemo />

<CodeRunner starter={`# Point Classifier with Pattern Matching 📍
def classify_point(point):
    match point:
        case (0, 0):
            return "🎯 Origin - The center of the universe!"
        case (0, y):
            return f"📏 On Y-axis at height {y}"
        case (x, 0):
            return f"📏 On X-axis at position {x}"
        case (x, y) if x == y:
            return f"↗️ On diagonal at ({x}, {y})"
        case (x, y) if x > 0 and y > 0:
            return f"📍 Quadrant I: ({x}, {y})"
        case (x, y):
            return f"📍 Point at ({x}, {y})"
        case _:
            return "🤷 Not a valid point!"

# Test various points
points = [(0, 0), (0, 5), (3, 0), (4, 4), (2, 3), (-1, 2)]
for point in points:
    print(f"{point} → {classify_point(point)}")
`} />

## 🔄 Loop Control: break and continue

Sometimes you need to control your loops like a DJ controls music - skip songs or stop the party! 🎵

### 🛑 The break Statement

<CodeRunner starter={`# Treasure Hunt Game! 💎
import random

print("🗺️  Welcome to Treasure Hunt!")
print("Find the treasure in 10 tries or less!\n")

for attempt in range(1, 11):
    guess = random.randint(1, 10)  # Simulating player guess
    treasure_location = 7  # Secret treasure location
    
    print(f"🔍 Attempt {attempt}: Searching at location {guess}")
    
    if guess == treasure_location:
        print(f"🏆 TREASURE FOUND! You found it in {attempt} attempts!")
        print("💰 You're rich! 💎✨")
        break  # Exit the loop immediately!
    else:
        print("❌ No treasure here... keep looking!")
        
else:
    # This runs only if the loop completes without break
    print("😔 Oh no! You ran out of attempts!")
    print(f"💡 The treasure was at location {treasure_location}!")
`} />

### ▶️ The continue Statement

<CodeRunner starter={`# Even Number Party! 🎉
print("🎈 Welcome to the Even Number Party!")
print("Only even numbers are invited!\n")

for number in range(1, 11):
    if number % 2 != 0:  # If number is odd
        print(f"🚫 {number} is odd - not invited!")
        continue  # Skip the rest and go to next iteration
    
    # This only runs for even numbers
    print(f"🎉 {number} is even - Welcome to the party!")
    print(f"   🍰 Here's your cake slice #{number//2}!")

print("\n🎊 Party complete! All even numbers celebrated!")
`} />

---

## 😴 The pass Statement

Sometimes you need a placeholder - like saying "I'll do this later!" The `pass` statement is perfect for this!

<CodeRunner starter={`# Building a Game Framework 🎮
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.health = 100
        self.score = 0
    
    def attack(self):
        pass  # TODO: Implement attack logic later
    
    def defend(self):
        pass  # TODO: Implement defense logic later
    
    def show_stats(self):
        print(f"👤 Player: {self.name}")
        print(f"❤️  Health: {self.health}")
        print(f"⭐ Score: {self.score}")

# For now, we can create players and show stats
player1 = Player("Hero")
player1.show_stats()

# The attack and defend methods exist but do nothing yet
player1.attack()  # Runs without error, does nothing
player1.defend()  # Runs without error, does nothing

print("🚧 Game framework ready for development!")
`} />

## 🎯 Real-World Challenge: Smart Calculator

Let's build a smart calculator that uses all our control flow knowledge!

<CodeRunner starter={`# Smart Calculator 🧮✨
def smart_calculator():
    print("🧮 Welcome to the Smart Calculator!")
    print("Available operations: +, -, *, /, %, **")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit\n")
    
    while True:
        try:

                ("2 ** 8", 2, "**", 8),
                ("quit", None, None, None)
            ]
            
            for display, a, op, b in operations:
                print(f"💭 Input: {display}")
                
                if display == "quit":
                    print("👋 Thanks for using Smart Calculator!")
                    return
                
                # Handle division by zero
                if op == "/" and b == 0:
                    print("⚠️  Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
                    continue
                
                # Perform calculation using match
                match op:
